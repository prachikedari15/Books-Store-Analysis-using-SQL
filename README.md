<h1>📚 Books Store Analysis Using SQL</h1>

<p>This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a fictional bookstore database using SQL. By leveraging SQL queries, it extracts meaningful insights from customer, book, and order data across various business dimensions such as sales, stock, customer behavior, and revenue.</p>

<h2>📊 Project Objective</h2>

<p>The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL and generate insights to support inventory decisions, sales monitoring, and customer engagement strategies, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>📗 Book genre trends</li>
  <li>📦 Stock management</li>
  <li>💰 Revenue tracking</li>
  <li>🛍️ Customer purchase behavior</li>
  <li>✍️ Author and title-level performance</li>
</ul>

<p>These insights enable better business decisions for managing book inventory, identifying best-selling genres, and understanding customer activity.</p>

<h2>🛠 Tools & Technologies</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SQL</strong> (MySQL or SQL Server)</li>
  <li>SQL Concepts: <code>JOIN</code>, <code>GROUP BY</code>, <code>HAVING</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, <code>LIMIT</code>, <code>AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS</code></li>
  <li>Tools used: MySQL Workbench / DBeaver / SSMS</li>
</ul>

<h2>📁 Dataset Overview</h2>

<p>The project uses synthetic CSV datasets representing a simplified bookstore management system:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Books.csv</code> – Book details with price, genre, stock, and author</li>
  <li><code>Orders.csv</code> – Orders with date, quantity, total amount, and book reference</li>
  <li><code>Customers.csv</code> – Customer demographics including name, city, and country</li>
</ul>

<p>🔐 <strong>Note:</strong> The dataset is fictional and anonymized. No personal or sensitive information is included.</p>

  <li>🔍 Find top authors and best-selling books</li>
  <li>👥 Track customer activity (e.g., customers with 2+ orders)</li>
  <li>📉 Genre-level and author-level sales performance</li>
  <li>📍 Location-based spending trends and top spenders</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧠 Skills Demonstrated</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Writing clean and efficient SQL queries</li>
  <li>Using joins and aggregations for multi-table analysis</li>
